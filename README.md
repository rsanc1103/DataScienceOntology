# Flask Installation
Follow these steps to install Flask on your local development environment:

# Prerequisites
Before installing Flask, you'll need the following software installed on your machine:

Python: Flask is a Python web framework, so you'll need Python installed. You can download Python from the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
Installation Steps
Open a command prompt or terminal window.

(Optional) It's recommended to create and activate a virtual environment to isolate your Flask project's dependencies. You can create a virtual environment using the venv module in Python. For example:

On Windows:
> python -m venv myenv

> myenv\Scripts\activate

On macOS or Linux:

> $ python3 -m venv myenv

> $ source myenv/bin/activate

Install Flask using pip, the Python package manager:

> (myenv) $ pip install flask

You're now ready to start building Flask applications!
> python app.py
